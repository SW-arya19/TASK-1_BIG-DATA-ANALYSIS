**COMPANY**:CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS 

**NAME**: SWADHA ARYA

**INTERNID**:CT12NGK


**DOMAIN**:DATA ANALYTICS

**BATCH DURATION**:JANUARY 25, 2025 TO MARCH 25 , 2025

**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

**DESCRIPTION**:
This project focuses on analyzing an **Amazon Order dataset** using **PySpark**, showcasing its capabilities in handling large-scale data efficiently. The analysis begins with **data loading and preprocessing**, ensuring the dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types for accurate analysis.  

The **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** covers key aspects such as **order status distribution**, identifying the most frequently ordered **categories and SKUs**, and examining the impact of different **fulfillment sales channels**. The analysis also includes **order trends and sales insights**, where monthly sales patterns are visualized, along with an evaluation of the most common **shipping cities and states**.  

Further, the project delves into **customer and regional analysis**, identifying key locations with the highest number of orders and computing the **average order value** across different product categories. To enhance data interpretation, **visualizations** using **Matplotlib and Seaborn** are incorporated, including **bar charts for order status, pie charts for category-wise sales, and heatmaps for regional trends**.  

By leveraging PySpark's **DataFrame API**, this project demonstrates efficient **big data processing** while drawing meaningful insights from real-world e-commerce data.
